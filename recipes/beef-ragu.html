        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p id="desc">Beef ragu is a rich and hearty Italian dish featuring tender, slow-cooked beef 
            simmered in a robust tomato sauce infused with aromatic herbs, garlic, and 
            red wine. This savory sauce is traditionally served over fresh pasta, such as 
            pappardelle or tagliatelle, and topped with a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese. 
            The slow-cooking process allows the flavors to meld beautifully, resulting in a 
            deeply flavorful and comforting meal perfect for any occasion.</p>

        <h2 class="heading" id="">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="parent1">
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons harissa (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 pound pappardelle pasta, cooked and drained</li>
            <li>grated Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="parent2">
            <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. 
                Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Sear meat until browned 
                on every side, working in batches if necessary, about 10 minutes. Remove from 
                Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, 
                stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, 
                stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and 
                tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot 
                with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds, 
                about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 
                teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, 
                until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors meld, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch 
                oven to a cutting board and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in 
                pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
